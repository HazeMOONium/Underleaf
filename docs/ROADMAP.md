## Near-term (next sprint)

High value, low effort items that can be shipped quickly.

| # | Feature | Effort | Status |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **LaTeX engine selector** | S | ✅ Done — migration 004, engine column, PATCH route, worker reads engine |
| 2 | **Word / character count status bar** | S | ✅ Done — 22px status bar below Monaco, updates on ytext observe |
| 3 | **Join / leave toasts** | XS | ✅ Done — awareness change handler, tracks names, react-hot-toast |
| 4 | **New project from template** | S | ✅ Done — 4 templates (article, beamer, report, CV), modal on dashboard |
| 5 | **New folder button in file tree** | XS | ✅ Done — folder-plus button in sidebar header, modal prompt |

## Editor improvements

### Spell check

Integrate `nspell` (hunspell-compatible JS) for English spell checking in Monaco.

- Register a Monaco `setModelMarkers` provider that runs nspell on the text content of each LaTeX paragraph (ignoring commands, math, and environments)
- Show squiggle underlines + hover suggestions
- Language selector (en-US / en-GB / de / fr / es) stored in user profile
- **Effort**: M (3–4h)

### ~~Enhanced LaTeX diagnostics~~ ✅ Done

Duplicate `\label` detection added to `registerLatexDiagnostics`. Existing checks already covered: unmatched `\begin/\end`, missing `\end{document}`, unclosed `$$`/`$`.

### ~~File/folder context menu~~ ✅ Done

Right-click context menu (was already partially there). Added:
- **Duplicate** for files (creates `name-copy.ext` with same content)
- **Delete All** for folders (deletes all children with confirmation)
- **⋮ kebab button** on hover for each row (opens same context menu)

### ~~Multi-cursor find & replace~~ ✅ Done

Ctrl+H opens Monaco's built-in find/replace widget. Ctrl+Shift+F opens a custom project-wide
search overlay — searches all `.tex/.bib/.sty` files, shows file:line:preview results,
click to navigate. Also reachable from the command added in `handleEditorMount`.

### ~~Vim / Emacs keybindings~~ ✅ Done

Keybinding mode selector (Normal / Vim / Emacs) in the editor header. Preference persisted
in localStorage. Vim mode uses `monaco-vim` with a status bar indicator in the footer.
Emacs mode uses `monaco-emacs`.

---

## Collaboration

### Snapshot / version history

Track a history of compile events as "snapshots":

- Each successful compile creates a `Snapshot` record pointing to the compiled PDF
- Version history panel in the editor shows a timeline
- Click a snapshot → view the PDF from that point in time
- "Restore" button re-uploads the snapshot's files as the current version
- **Backend**: new `Snapshot` model + API endpoints
- **Effort**: L (6–8h)

### ~~Comment notification emails~~ ✅ Done

Notifications sent via `BackgroundTasks` (no-op when SMTP not configured):
- New top-level comment → project owner notified
- Reply → parent comment's author notified
- Thread resolved → root comment author notified

### ~~Presence improvements~~ ✅ Done

Presence bar capped at 3 peer avatars + overflow `+N` badge with tooltip listing hidden names.

---

## Auth & access

### ~~JWT refresh tokens~~ ✅ Done

Access tokens reduced to 15 min; long-lived refresh tokens (30 days) in httpOnly cookie.
`POST /auth/refresh` rotates the token. Axios interceptor retries on 401 with queuing.
CORS updated to specific origins (required for `withCredentials`).

### Two-factor authentication (TOTP)

Add TOTP-based 2FA:

- `POST /auth/2fa/enable` — generate TOTP secret + QR code
- `POST /auth/2fa/verify` — confirm setup with a code
- Login flow: after password, prompt for 6-digit TOTP code if 2FA enabled
- Backup codes (10 single-use codes)
- **Effort**: L (6–8h)

### OAuth / SSO login

Add Google and GitHub OAuth2 login:

- Redirect to provider → callback → create/link account
- Store provider + provider user ID in Users table
- Allow linking multiple providers to one account
- **Effort**: L (6–8h)

---

## Compile pipeline

### Pre-warmed worker pool

Current architecture: one worker container, cold start per job. Improve:

- Keep N worker containers alive (configurable pool size)
- Workers listen on the queue and process jobs immediately (no container spin-up delay)
- Scale pool based on queue depth (auto-scaling via Docker API or Kubernetes HPA)
- **Effort**: L (8–12h)

### ~~Compile with bibliography (latexmk)~~ ✅ Done

Worker detects `latexmk` availability at runtime (`shutil.which`) and uses it when present (`-pdf`/`-xelatex`/`-lualatex` flags). Falls back to direct engine invocation otherwise.

### Compile error linking to files

When parsing structured errors from pdflatex output, resolve relative file paths (e.g. `./sections/intro.tex`) to the project's file tree. Show clickable file:line links in the error panel that navigate the editor to the error location.

Currently partial — implement full resolution for multi-file projects.

- **Effort**: S (2–3h)

### ~~Draft / fast compile mode~~ ✅ Done

"Draft" button added to editor header — sends `draft: true` flag, worker passes `-draftmode` to the engine for fast syntax checking without PDF generation.

---

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### ~~Structured JSON logging~~ ✅ Done

`JSONFormatter` emits all extra fields as top-level JSON keys (`method`, `path`, `status`, `duration` ms, `request_id`). `LoggingMiddleware` logs a clean `"request"` message with structured extras.

### ~~Prometheus metrics dashboard~~ ✅ Done

`deploy/grafana/dashboards/underleaf.json` — pre-built dashboard with panels:
request rate, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, compile throughput, stat tiles.
Prometheus (port 19090) and Grafana (port 13000) added to `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
Grafana auto-provisions the datasource and dashboard on startup.

### Production Docker Compose hardening

Review `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` for production readiness:

- Non-root users for all containers
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Secret management (Docker secrets or env file encryption)
- Resource limits (`mem_limit`, `cpu_quota`)
- Restart policies
- **Effort**: M (2–3h)

### Kubernetes Helm chart

For teams wanting to deploy to Kubernetes:

- Helm chart with configurable replicas, ingress, TLS, persistent volumes
- HPA for backend and worker pods
- NetworkPolicy to restrict pod-to-pod traffic
- **Effort**: XL (16–24h)

---

## Performance & scalability

### ~~Backend connection pooling~~ ✅ Done

`database.py` now uses `pool_size=10`, `max_overflow=20`, `pool_timeout=30`, `pool_pre_ping=True`.

### MinIO multipart uploads

For large files (images, fonts > 5MB), use MinIO's multipart upload API instead of loading the entire file into memory. This reduces backend peak memory usage.

- **Effort**: S (2–3h)

### CDN / object storage presigned URL caching

Cache presigned URLs in Redis for the duration of their validity (15 min) to avoid re-signing the same object on every page load.

- **Effort**: S (1–2h)

### Collab server horizontal scaling

The current Yjs WebSocket server is single-process. For multiple instances:

- Use `y-redis` (official package) to synchronize `Y.Doc` state across multiple collab server instances via Redis pub/sub
- Each instance reads/writes from the same Redis cluster
- Enables load balancing WebSocket connections across instances
- **Effort**: M (3–5h)

## Future / exploratory

These are larger or more speculative features for later consideration.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Git integration** | Automatically commit each compile snapshot to a Git repo. Push/pull from GitHub/GitLab. Browse history as git log. |
| **Template marketplace** | Community-contributed project templates. Upload, browse, and fork templates from a gallery. |
| **VS Code extension** | Thin client that bridges a local VS Code instance to a remote Underleaf project for full offline editing with sync. |
| **Full-text search** | Index LaTeX AST across all project files. Search for `\label`, `\cite`, section titles, arbitrary text. |
| **Export to Word/HTML** | Use Pandoc to convert compiled LaTeX to DOCX or HTML for sharing with non-LaTeX users. |
| **Multi-compiler images** | Support TeXLive full, TeXLive minimal, and Tectonic as separate worker images. User selects compiler image per project. |
| **Quotas & billing** | Per-user or per-team storage and compile quotas. Usage dashboards. Optional Stripe billing for hosted deployments. |
| **SAML / LDAP SSO** | Enterprise SSO integration for institutional deployments. |
| **Mobile app** | Read-only viewer and lightweight editing for tablets via a React Native wrapper. |
